# I'm just messing around!

Wow. I sure hope this works. 

I plan on using this site to organize and display my MA thesis in a virtual format. The working title of the thesis is ***"Secured Through Stone: The Artifactual Afterlife of the Viking Age Queen Thrya"*** The first chapter explores the textual evidence relating to Thyra, before moving on to the material evidence in the second chapter, before wrapping up with a view of Thyra's legacy from the vantage point of modern cultural institutions such as museums.
